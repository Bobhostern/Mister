# MISTER CORE

In anticipation of native plugins (a big maybe), I'm separating most of the core
types of MISTER from the executable.
This file will allow things that want to interact with MISTER to do so.

If you want an analogy for these projects, MISTER CORE is the parts of a machine,
with MISTER is those parts arrange in a semblance of proper.

## TODO
- [x] Create image buffers (preliminary model)
- [ ] Start planning the GUI system
- [ ] Draw an image buffer to the screen programmatically
